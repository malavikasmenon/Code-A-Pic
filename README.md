# Code-A-Pic
Coding a picture - a reflection on media and society - using Python (Turtle)

## Picture Description

The picture is meant as a reflection on the amount of coverage different issues get in the media (Obvious much!). In general, we can see the elite (AKA the stars and actors) getting more coverage for seemingly trivial issues, while something as important as the new proposed EIA Draft or the Assam flood is left unnoticed. Oh and if we focus on Kerala, its the gold seizig case that gains much traction!

The picture is creating using the Turtle module in Python.
